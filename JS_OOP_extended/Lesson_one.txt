Creating and managing object literals:

An object is used to represent specific entity through an aggregation of data and functionalities.

The data is called properties and represented by pairs of names and values.

The functionalities are usually called methods and are represented by functions.

The simplest way to create an object in JS is the literal representation:

var emptyObject ={};

var person = {"name":"John","surname":"Smith"};
person.greet = function(){
    return`Hello There`
}
